 * This is test code to test communication between 
 * and arduino board (in this case I used an Edison
 * arduino board) and the SuperPro board.
 * The Arduino sample a sonar sensor I had laying 
 * around and converted the byte of data to a string of
 * binary 0s and 1s which was then wrote to 8 pins.
 * 
 * TODO:
 * updated code to work with I2C sensor
